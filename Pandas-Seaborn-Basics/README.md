# CSE 142 Assignment: Naive Bayes and Data Analysis

This project contains a CSE 142 assignment designed to introduce the basics of **pandas**, **Seaborn**, and the mathematical foundations of **Naive Bayes**. The assignment focuses on exploring datasets, performing simple data analysis, and understanding probabilistic classification.

## Project Overview
The assignment includes tasks such as:

- Loading and exploring datasets using **pandas**  
- Visualizing data distributions with **Seaborn**  
- Implementing **Naive Bayes** classifiers and understanding their math  
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics
