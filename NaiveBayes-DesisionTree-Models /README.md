# Machine Learning Classification Project

This project implements supervised learning algorithms on the **Mushroom** and **Congressional Voting Records** datasets. Both custom implementations and standard models are used to evaluate performance across different hyperparameters.

## Project Overview
The datasets used in this project are:

- **Mushroom dataset:** Contains features of different mushroom species, labeled as edible or poisonous.  
- **Congressional Voting Records dataset:** Contains voting records of U.S. House of Representatives members for different issues, labeled by party.

The main goal of this project is to classify the data points correctly using two different algorithms:

- **Naive Bayes**  
- **Decision Trees**

Performance is evaluated using **accuracy scores** and **confusion matrices**.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook **NB_Tree.ipynb** in **Google Colab**.  
2. Results and plots are already included in the notebook.  
3. To reproduce the results, ensure all dataset files are in the same folder as the notebook.  
4. Click **"Run All"** at the top of the notebook to rerun experiments.
