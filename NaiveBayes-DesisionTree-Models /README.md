Overview

This project contains experiments using Naive Bayes and Decision trees on the Mushroom and Congressional Voting Records datasets. Various hyperparameters and formula combinations were tested using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

Running the Code

All code has been run in Google Colab, so the outputs are already visible. You do not need to rerun the notebook to see the results.

If you want to rerun the experiments for verification:

Upload all files inside the folder onto to Google Colab. 

Simply click "run all" at the very top.

The results for each model and dataset will be printed out automatically.
