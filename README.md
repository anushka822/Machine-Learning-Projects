# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects that implement core machine learning algorithms from scratch. Each project includes both **source code** and a **written report** explaining the methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions.

## 📁 Projects Included

### **Pandas-Seaborn-Basics**

Covers introductory data exploration and visualization using:

* Pandas for data manipulation
* Seaborn for statistical visualizations
  Useful as a foundation for later ML projects.

---

### **KNN-GMM-Clustering**

Implements two unsupervised learning approaches:

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification
* **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** using Expectation-Maximization
  Includes clustering visualizations and evaluation.

---

### **NaiveBayes-DesisionTree-Models**

Implements:

* **Naïve Bayes Classifier**
* **Decision Tree Classifier**
  Includes entropy/Gini calculations, prediction logic, and experiment results.

---

### **Perceptron-SVM-Logistic**

Implements core linear ML algorithms from scratch:

* **Perceptron**
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
* **Logistic Regression**
  Projects explore linear separability, gradient-based optimization, and hyperparameter impacts.

## 📄 Repository Notes

* Each project folder contains its own **code**, **documentation**, and **report**.
* Some hidden system files like `.DS_Store` may appear on macOS; these can be safely deleted or ignored.
