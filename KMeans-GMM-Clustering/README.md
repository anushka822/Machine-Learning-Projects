# Machine Learning Clustering Project

This project implements **unsupervised clustering algorithms** on a dataset containing species measurements. Both custom implementations and Scikit-Learn models are used to compare performance.

## Project Overview

The dataset (`hw4 dataset`) contains **length** and **width** of several species. The species are unlabeled, making this an **unsupervised learning task**. The main goal of this project is to classify the data points into clusters that can represent different species.

Two clustering algorithms were implemented:

1. **K-Means Clustering**
2. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering**

├─ K_Means_and_GMM_.ipynb                                # Notebook containing models, with graphs for results 
├─ hw4_dataset.csv                                       # Input dataset
├─ K_Means_and_Gaussian_Mixture_Model__GMM_.pdf          # Report contains details on models and results 
└─ README.md
```


## Usage

1. Open the notebook K_Means_and_GMM_.ipynb in Google Colab.
2. Results and plots are already included in the notebook.
3. To reproduce the results, ensure the dataset hw4_dataset.csv is in the same folder as the notebook.
